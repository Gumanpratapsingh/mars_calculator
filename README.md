# mars_calculator
I made a Calculator which is a Command-Line-Application Built on Rust Programming Language.
This Calculator bascially tells your weight on mars by taking the input of the your's weight on earth.
I learnt some topic from rust such as references,immutable pointers or variable,what are the macros and how they are different .
Learned Basic of Rust.
